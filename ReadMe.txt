1 ) Install and run a server software in Windows:	
	- If your computer contains a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is sufficient to download a file with a ".jar" extension. 
	  Otherwise download a file with a ".exe" extension, run it and install the JRE from a refer page.
	- After downloading the file UnderControl.jar you donÂ´t need any installation. Just run the program.
	- If you want to control your computer even in secure situations provided by Windows, you have
	  to run the program as an administrator.
	- When you start the program, program tray icon appear in a notification area of a taskbar and informs you  
	  about starting communication servers.
	- Clicking on the tray icon displays a window with the details. This window allows you to change a 
	  language, stop servers and re-run them (you can change a base port for servers, but it must be the same as a
	  base port in a mobile device).
	- If the program starts up correctly, Bluetooth server "Listening for a connect" and Wifi server "Listening on IP ..." .
	- To close the application, you need to right click on the notification icon and select EXIT.
(Note. the program in an idle state does not burden the system. Consequently, many users will appreciate its automatic startup after a boot. This can be achieved, when you put the program into a "StartUp" folder, which is provided by the operating system Windows.)

2 ) Establishing a connection:
	- After you run an application on your smartphone, you need to select one of the connection mode. In all  
	  cases must be the server program running.
	- If you choose a Touchpad - Bluetooth, you must locate devices in your area (If you have not previously 
	  paired any devices). After the searching, click on a name of a selected device and the system tries to
	  establish the connection. First connecting may take several seconds and may be required pairing of devices.
	- If you choose one of options to connect via WiFi, you need to enter a IP address of the computer, which 
	  runs the server program. The IP address can be found in the window of the running server program, 
	  on a line called "Wifi server".
	- If you try to connect to the computer, Bluetooth or Wifi server displays "Connecting". If not, the device can not
	  communicate. This can be caused by a firewall, which blocking traffic for a given application. Try allow the program 
	  in your firewall.
3) Basic control application:
	- A control is similar to a standard control laptop using a touchpad with two buttons.
	- Left and right clicks is realized by a pair of outer buttons (left click can also be accessed by clicking
	  two fingers on a control surface).
	- Scrolling pages allows a slider.
	- Text selection is carried out by pressing the left button and moving a second finger on the control surface.
	- Call up a keyboard and other functions are provided by a middle button menu.
